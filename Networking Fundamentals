  ~Protocol Data Unit = PDU Data referring to layers of OSI Model
    Session-Application = Data
    Transport = Segment/Datagram
    Network = Packet
    Data Link = Frame
    Physical = Bit

  ~Internet Standards Organizations
    IETF - RFC’s
    IANA - Internet Numbers
    IEEE - LAN/WAN electrical standards

  ~Layer 1 (Binary,Decimal,Hexadecimal,Base64)
    Binary = Base2 0,1
      Groupings: bit, nibble, byte, half-word, word
    Decimal = Base10 (0-9)
    Hexadecimal = base16 (0-9 A-f)
    Base64 = 64 symbols (A-z,a-z,0-9,+,/)
    (=) is to represent a null value

  ~Lan Topologies
    Bus - two way hits every station
    Star - one central node
    Ring - everyone connected to everyone one way flow
    Mesh - everyone connected to everyone usually networking devices
    Wireless - radius to connect to (roaming) reconnect as you move
    Hierarchial - (Companies, Organizations) Internet, core, distribution, Access
    Users not at core layer.

  ~Devices
    Hubs - Input data and foward it 
    Repeaters - Extend Range
    Switches - Network foward to specific address
    Routers - connect to other networks

  ~Ethernet Timing (Bit-Time)
    Speed	Bit-time
    10 Mbps  100ns
    100 Mbps  10ns
    1 Gbps  1ns
    10 Gbps  .1ns
    100 Gbps  .01ns

  ~Layer 2 (2 Sub-Layers)
    MAC -Medium Access Control
    LLC - Logical Link Control
     
    Header - Layer 2 to Layer 7
    Data - Payload
    Footer - FCS/CRC
    
  ~Switch Operation
    Building MAC-Address (CAM) Table
      Learns by reading Source MAC addresses
    Forwarding Frames
      Decision based on Destination MAC address

  Switching Modes
    Cut-Through
    Fragment-Free
    Store-and-Forward

  ~CAM Tabel Overflow Attack
    Send frames with bogus source MAC address to switch
    Cause switch to fill table with bogus addresses
    Switch will not be able to learn new (valid) MAC addresses

  ~Mac Addressing (Length: 48-bit | 6 byte | 12 Hex)
    Format:
      Windows: 01-23-45-12-34-56
      Unix/Linux: 01:23:45:12:34:56
      Cisco: 1234.5612.3456

    Parts:
      OUI - First 24-bits assigned by IANA
      Vendor Assigned - Last 24-bits assigned by vendor

  Types
    Unicast: One to one 8th bit is off
    Multicast: One to many 8th bit is on
    Broadcast: One to all All bits on

  ~MAC Spoofing
    Could not be changed at first
    Used to be called:
    hardware
    firmware
    burned-in
    Now it can be changed w/ software

  ~Data-Link frame headers
    EtherTyper
    0x0800 = IPv4
    0X0806 = ARP
    0X86DD = IPv6
    0X8100 = VLAN Tag
    0x88A8 = 2 Tags

  ~VLAN 
    Default - VLAN 1
    Data - User traffic
    Voice - VOIP traffic
    Management - Switch and router management
    Native - Untagged switch and router traffic

  ~VLAN Hopping Attcak
    Switch Spoofing (DTP)
    Single Tagging
    Double Tagging (using native VLAN)
    SCAPY - application to build code

  ~ARP
    Types
      ARP (OP 1 and 2)
      RARP (OP 3 and 4)
      Proxy ARP (OP 2)
      Gratuitous ARP (OP 2)

  ~ARP Cache
    All resolved MAC to IP resolutions
    If MAC is not in cache then ARP is used
    Dynamic entries last from 2-20 minutes
    Default gateway is present at minimum
    Can be easily duped by attackers

  ~Man-in-the-middle (MITM) w/ ARP
    Poison ARP Cache with:
      Gratuitous ARP
      Proxy ARP

  ~VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)
    Dynamically add/remove/modify VLANs
    Cisco proprietary
      Modes:Server,Client,Transparent
      
    VTP Vulnerability
      Can cause switches to dump all VLAN information
      Cause a DoS as switch will not support configured VLANS

  ~Dynamic Trunking Protocol
    Used to dynamically create trunk links
    Cisco proprietary
      Modes:Dynamic-Auto,Dynamic-Desirable

  (DTP) Vulnerability
    On by default
    Can send crafted messages to form a VLAN trunk link
    Recommend to:
    Disable DTP negotiations
    Manually assign as Access or Trunk

  ~CDP
    CDP, FDP, and LLDP
    Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP)
    Foundry Discovery Protocol (FDP)
    Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP)

  CDP, FDP, and LLDP Vulnerability
    Leaks valuable information
    Clear Text
    Enabled by default

    Disable it:
      Globally
      Per interface
      May require it for VOIP

  ~Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
    Root decision process
    Elect root Bridge
    Identify the Root ports on non-root bridge
    Identify the Designated port for each segment
    Set alternate ports to blocking state
  Types
    802.1D STP
    Per VLAN Spanning Tree + (PVST+)
    802.1w – Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP)
    Rapid Per VLAN Spanning Tree + (RPVST+)
    802.1s (Multiple Spanning Tree)

  ~Spanning Tree Attack
    Crafted Bridge Protocol Data units (BPDU)
    Used to perform a DoS or MitM

  ~Port Security
    Shutdown (default)
    Protect - Keep link up with established MAC address
    Restrict - do not allow anyone but the MAC address on this port

    Port Security Can help to
    Restrict unauthorized access
    Limit MAC address learned on port
    Prevent CAM Table Overflow attacks

    Port Security Vulnerabilities
    Dependant on MAC address
    MAC spoofing

  ~Layer 2 Attack Mitigation
    Shutdown unused ports
    Enable Port Security
    IP Source Guard
    Manually assign STP Root
    BPDU Guard
    DHCP Snooping

    802.1x - log into authentication server
    Dynamic ARP inspection (DAI) - inspect ARP traffic and look for oddities
    Static CAM entries
    Static ARP entries
    Disable DTP negotiations
    Manually assign Access/Trunk ports
