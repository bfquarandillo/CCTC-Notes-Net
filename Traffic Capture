Traffic Capture - Day 2

  ~Outcomes
    Describe Network Traffic Sniffing
    Perform real-time network traffic sniffing

  ~Practical Use
    Network troubleshooting
    Diagnosing improper routing or switching
    Identifying port/protocol misconfigurations
    Monitor networking consumption
    Intercepting usernames and passwords
    Eavesdrop on network communications

  ~Disadvantages
    Requires elevate permissions - (Sudo tcpdump)
    Can only capture what NIC can see
    Cannot capture local traffic
    Can consume massive amounts of system resources
    Lost packets on busy networks

  ~Two ways to capture - hardwar and software packet sniffers
