    Demonstrate Anomaly Analysis
    Define Decoding
    Demonstrate Decoding

  ~Tools
    -Sensors
      In-Line
        Test Access Point (TAP)
        Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
      Out of Band (Passive)
        Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN)

  ~In-line Sensor
    Placed between communicating devices to stop attack 
    Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
    Firewall
    Impacts network latency

  ~Passive Sensor
    Monitors network segments
    Can detect attacks but cannot stop them
    Gets copies of network traffic
      Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
    Does not impact network latency

  ~TAP
    Appliance placed between 2 network devices
    Best for packet collection with no data loss
    Must be placed "in line" of network traffic
    Not Scalable
    Will need several installed to capture traffic for other network segments

  ~MITM
    Attacker can use ARP or some other method/protocol
    Attackers can sniff or manipulate traffic that flows through them
    Typically must be on the same network as the victim
    Traffic capture is dependent on the attacker’s system and bandwidth

  ~Span
    Configured on the network Switch
    Best for packet collection of traffic from several switch ports at once
    Scalable
    Can have a high degree of packet loss
    Places burden on the network Switch

  ~Defaul Characteristics For System Identification

  ~Fingerprinting and Host Identification
    Variances in the RFC implementation for different OS’s and systems enables the capability for fingerprinting
    Tools used for fingerprinting and host identification can be used passively(sniffing/fingerprinting) or actively(scanning)
      
  ~Fingerprinting

  ~Active OS fingerprinting
    Easier
    Send packets to the target and monitor response
    Tools:
      Nmap
      Xprobe2
      sinfp3

  ~Passive OS fingerprinting
    More difficult
    Rely on sniffing packets
    Tools:
      p0f
      Ettercap
      PRADS

  ~Windows
    88 - Kerberos / Domain Controller
    137/138/139 - NetBIOS
    445 - SMB

  ~Linux
    22 - SSH
    111 - SUN RPC

  ~Ephemeral Ports
    IANA 49152–65535
    Linux 32768–60999
    Windows XP 1025–5000
    Win 7/8/10 use IANA
    Win Server 2008 1025–60000
    Sun Solaris 32768–65535

  ~Protocol specific identifiers
    HTTP: User-agent strings (web browser can identify client info)
    SSH: Initial connection
    NetBIOS Name Service (resolves netbios names to IPs)

  ~P0f
    Looks at variations in initial TTL, fragmentation flag, default IP header packet length, window size, and TCP options
    Configuration stored in:
    /etc/p0f/p0f.fp

  ~Network Traffic Baselining
    
  ~What is Baselining?
    Snapshot of what the network looks like during a time frame
    No industry standard
    7 days to establish the initial snapshot (but a month is preferred)
    Prerequisite Information

  ~Network Baseline Objective
    Determines the current state of your network
    Ascertain the current utilization of network resources
    Identify normal vs peak network traffic time frames
    Verify port/protocol usage
