Network Analysis - Day 6

  ~Outcomes
    Discuss Network Traffic Baselining
    Discuss How to Analyze Network Statistics
    Demonstrate Network Statistics
    Identify Types of Malware
    Discuss Post Compromise Analysis
    Demonstrate Anomaly Analysis
    Define Decoding
    Demonstrate Decoding

  ~Tools
    -Sensors
      In-Line
        Test Access Point (TAP)
        Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
      Out of Band (Passive)
        Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN)

  ~In-line Sensor
    Placed between communicating devices to stop attack 
    Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
    Firewall
    Impacts network latency

  ~Passive Sensor
    Monitors network segments
    Can detect attacks but cannot stop them
    Gets copies of network traffic
      Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
    Does not impact network latency

  ~TAP
    Appliance placed between 2 network devices
    Best for packet collection with no data loss
    Must be placed "in line" of network traffic
    Not Scalable
    Will need several installed to capture traffic for other network segments

  ~MITM
    Attacker can use ARP or some other method/protocol
    Attackers can sniff or manipulate traffic that flows through them
    Typically must be on the same network as the victim
    Traffic capture is dependent on the attacker’s system and bandwidth

  ~Span
    Configured on the network Switch
    Best for packet collection of traffic from several switch ports at once
    Scalable
    Can have a high degree of packet loss
    Places burden on the network Switch

  ~Defaul Characteristics For System Identification

  ~Fingerprinting and Host Identification
    Variances in the RFC implementation for different OS’s and systems enables the capability for fingerprinting
    Tools used for fingerprinting and host identification can be used passively(sniffing/fingerprinting) or actively(scanning)
