  Network Layer - Day 1

  ~Outcomes
    Explain Layer 3 Routing Technologies
    Describe Security Implications Present in Header Fields

  ~IP Networking
    Network Layer
      Addressing Schemes for Network (Logical Addressing)
      Routing
      Encapsulation
      IP Fragmentation and Reassembly
      Error Handling and Diagnostics

  ~Internet Protocol Versions
    IPv4 (ARPANET 1982)
      Classful subnetting
      Classless subnetting (CIDR)
      NAT
    IPv6 (Standardized 2017)

  ~Classful IPv4 Addressing and Subnetting
    Class A (0 to 127)
    Class B (128 to 191)
    Class C (192 to 223)
    Class D (224 to 239) - Multicasting
    Class E (240 to 255) - Not used

  ~Subnetting
    IP addresses:
      Network Portion
      Host Portion
    Practice of "borrowing" host bits and used them as subnet bits.

  ~IPv4 Header

  ~IPv4 Address Types
    Unicast - Any Class A thu C
    Multicast - Class D
    Broadcast - Any IP were the host portion is all on

  ~IPv4 Address Scopes
    Public
    Private (RFC 1918)
    Loopback (127.0.0.0/8)
    Link-Local (APIPA) - auto assign IP address
    Multicast (class D)

  ~IPv4 Fragmentation
    Breaking up packets from higher MTU to lower MTU network
    Performed by routers
    MF flag is on from 1st until 2nd to last
    Offset is on from 2nd until the last - how computer keeps track of packets
    Offset = (MTU - (IHL x 4)) ÷ 8
    Last Packet hs MF flag off but offset value is greater than 0

  ~IPv6 Fragmentation
    IPv6 does not support fragmentation within it’s header
    Routers do not fragment IPv6 packets
    Source adjusts MTU to avoid fragmentation
    Source can use IPv6 fragmentation extension header

  ~Fragmentation Vulnerability
    Can use fragmentation overlaps to avoid firewall detection
    Attack depends on how OS deals with overlap
    Example: Teardrop attack

  ~OS Fingerprinting with TTL
    Vendors have chosen different values for TTL which can provide insight to which OS family a generated packet is from.

    Linux (kernel 2.4 and 2.6) 64 TTL 5840 window size
    Google custon linux  64 5720
    FreeBSD 64 65535
    Windows Xp 128 65535
    Windows 7, Vista and Server 2008 128 8192
    Cisco Router (IOS 12.4) 255 4128

  ~IPv4 Auto Config
    APIPA
      169.254.0.0/16
      RFC 3927
    DHCP
      DORA process
      RFC 1531

  ~IPv4 Auto Configuration Vulnerability
    Rogue DHCP
    Evil Twin - DHCP pretends to be another but is closer
    DHCP Starvation - Taking all assignable IPs

  ~ICMPv4 (echo request and echo reply)
    Internet Control Management Protocol

  ~ICMPv4 OS Fingerprinting
    Linux:
      Default size: 64 bytes
      Payload message:
      !\”#\$%&\‘()*+,-./01234567

    Windows:
      Default size: 40 bytes
      Payload message:
      abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwabcdefghi

   ~ICMPv4 Traceroute
    Identifies hops between the source and destination
    Uses incrementing TTLs
    Hops return an ICMP Type 11 Time exceeded message when TTL reaches zero
    Continues until it reaches target or 30 hops*

  Can use various protocols and ports
    ICMP (windows default)
    UDP (linux default)
    TCP - Manually Set for TCP

  (Linux)
  Default:
  traceroute 172.16.82.106
  traceroute -U 172.16.82.106

  Requires root:
  sudo traceroute -I 172.16.82.106
  sudo traceroute -T 172.16.82.106
  sudo traceroute -T 172.16.82.106 -p 443

  ~ICMPv4 Attacks
    Firewalking (traceroute)
    Oversized ICMP messages
    ICMP Redirects
    SMURF Attack
    Map network w/ IP unreachables
    ICMP Covert Channels

  ~IPv6 Addressing (does not support broadcast)
    128 bit address
    64-bit Prefix (4 hextets)
    64-bit Interface ID (4 hextets)
    340 undecillian addresses
    Represented using 32 Hex digits
    Hextet: 4 hex separated by (:)
    Unicast
    Multicast
    Anycast
    
  ~IPv6 Subnetting
    Organizations asigned a 48-bit Prefix by IANA
    Last 16-bits of prefix is used for subnetting
    Allows for upto 65,536 subnets to be created

  ~IPv6 Address Scopes
    Global Unicast Addresses (2000::/3)
    Unique Local (fc00::/7)
    Loopback (::1/128)
    Link-Local (fe80::/10)
    Multicast (ff00::/8)

  ~IPv6 Config 
    Link-Local
      Hosts generate link-local prefix (FE80::/8)
      Interface ID can be:
        Random (Windows default)
        EUI-64 (nix* and Cisco default)
    Global
      Hosts requests global prefix
        SLAAC (RFC 4862) (default)
        DHCPv6 (configured)
      Interface ID can be:
        EUI-64 (nix* and Cisco default)
        Random (Windows default)

  ~IPv6 Config Vulnerability
    SLAAC MitM
    Can be used to fingerprint OS
    Rogue DHCP
    Evil Twin
    DHCP Starvation

  ~Neighbor Discovery Protocol
    Router Solicitation (Type 133)
    Router Advertisement (Type 134)
    Neighbor Solicitation (Type 135)
    Neighbor Advertisement (Type 136)
    Redirect (Type 137)
