  ~Outcomes
    Explain OSI Layer 4 Ports, Protocols and Headers
    Explain OSI Layer 5 Protocols and Headers
    Explain OSI Layer 6 Functions and Responsibilities
    Explain OSI Layer 7 Protocols and Headers

  ~Protocols
    Connection-oriented
      TCP - Segments
      Unicast traffic
    Connection-less
      UDP - Datagrams
      Broadcast, Multicast, or Unicast Traffic

  ~Port Ranges
    0-1023 Well Known (System)
    1024 - 49151 Registered (User)
    49152-65535 Dynamic (Private)

  ~TCP Reliability
    Syn Syn-Ack Ack
    Syn-Ack = open port
    Syn = stealth scan not connection made not in logs

    Connection establishment
      3-way handshake
    Data Transfer
      Established phase
    Connection Termination
      4-way Termination
      Reset connection

  ~TCP Flags
    URG, ACK=0x10, PSH, RST, SYN=0x02, FIN, SYN-ACK=0x12

  ~TCP Options
    0 - End of Options
    1 - No Options (NOP)
    2 - Maximum Segment Size (MSS)
    3 - TCP Windows Scaling
    4 - Selective ACK (SACK) Permitted
    5 - SACK
    8 - TCP Timestamps

  ~VPN
    Types:
      Remote Access(client-to-site)
      Site-to-Site

  ~L2TP (UDP 1701)
    RFC 2661
    Origins from Cisco L2F and Microsoft PPTP
    Tunnel only. No Encryption.

  ~PPTP (TCP 1723)
    RFC 2637
    Microsoft
    Provides encryption
    Obsolete with many vulnerabilities

  ~L2F (UDP 1701)
    Cisco
    Tunnel only. No Encryption
    Requires L2F Network Server (LNS) and a L2F Access Concentrator (LAC)

  ~IPSEC
    Modes: Transport or Tunnel

    Headers:
    ESP (protocol 50)
    AH (protocol 51)
    IKE (UDP port 500 or 4500)

  ~OpenVPN
    Open source
    Uses OpenSSL for encryption
    UDP*/TCP port 1194

  ~Proxies
    Ask Proxy to do processes for you, can hide local IP from adversaries on other side.
    It allows proxy to control every part of process if someone connects to it proxy will see traffic
    even traffic that is not normally visible because it is loaded from the proxy. Control dat flow.

  ~SOCKS 4/5 (TCP 1080) (more generic proxy)
    RFC 1928
    Uses various Client / Server exchange messages
      Client can provide authentication to server
      Client can request connections from server

  ~SOCKS4
    No Authentication
    Only IPv4
    No UDP support
    No Proxy binding. Client’s IP is not relayed to destination.

  ~SOCKS5
    Various methods of Authentication
    IPv4 and IPv6 support
    UDP support
    Supports Proxy binding. Client’s IP is relayed to destination.

  ~NETBIOS
    TCP 139 and UDP 137/138
    Name Resolution (15 characters)
    Largely replaced by DNS

  ~SMB/CIFS (TCP 445)
    SMB Rides over Netbios
    Netbios Dgram Service - UDP 138
    Netbios Session Service - TCP 139
    SAMBA and CIFS are just flavors of SMB

  ~RPC (Any Port)
    Allows a program to execute a request on a local/remote computer
    Hides network complexities
    XML, JSON, SOAP, and gRPC
    User application will:
      Request for information from external server
      Receives the information from the external server
      Display collected data to User

  ~API
    Framework of rules and protocols for software components to interact.
    Methods, parameters, and data formats for requests and responses.
    REST and SOAP

  ~Layer 6 (data modification before it reaches user)
    Responsibilities
      Translation
      Formating
      Encoding (ASCII, EBCDIC, HEX, BASE64)
      Encryption (Symmetric or Asymmetric)
      Compression

  ~Layer 7
  
  Telnet (TCP 23)
    Remote Login
    Authentication
    Clear Text
    Credentials susceptible to interception
    
  SSH (TCP 22) (requires server)
    Messages provide:
    Client/server authentication
    Asymmetric or PKI for key exchange
    Symmetric for session
    User authentication
    Data stream channeling
    
~Components of SSH
  Client / Server / Session
  Keys:
    User Key - Asymmetric public key used to identify the user to the server
    Host Key - Asymmetric public key used to identify the server to the user
    Session Key - Symmetric key created by the client and server to protect the session’s communication.

  ~SSH Concerns
    Using password authentication only
    Key rotation
    Key management
    Implementation specification (libssh, sshtrangerthings)

  ~SSH-Keygen 
    Create your own SSH Public/Private keys
      -t Encryption (rsa|dsa|ecdsa|ed25519)
      -b Bit length (1024|2048|4096)
      -C Adds a comment
    ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

  ~SSH-Copy-ID
    Copies your SSH Public key to the remote server
    Saves key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on remote server
    Allows you to authenticate with server using your key instead of password
    Must secure your private key

  ~HTTP(s) (TCP 80/443)
    User Request methods
    GET / HEAD / POST / PUT
    Server response Codes
    100, 200, 300, 400, 500

  ~Vulnerabilities
    Flooding
    Amplification
    Low and slow
    Drive-By Downloads
    BeEF Framework

  ~DNS (TCP/UDP 53)
    DNS query/response
    Resolves Names to IP addresses
    Queries and responses use UDP
    DNS response larger than 512 bytes use TCP
    DNS Zone Transfer
    DNS Security

  ~DNS Records
    A - IPv4 record
    AAAA - IPv6 record
    MX - Mail Server record
    TXT - Human-readable text
    NS - Name Server record
    SOA - Start of Authority
