  ifyService and Network Discovery - Day 4

  ~Outcomes
    Define Passive Network Information Gathering
    Define Network Collection Devices and Relevant Data
    Discuss Passive Network Analysis
    Use Network Analysis Tools
    Discuss Active Network Reconnaissance
    Perform Scans and Analyze Results
    Discuss Network Artifact Correlation
    Complete Network Reconnaissance

  ~Recon Stages
    Passive External - OSINT, DNS, Google searches, people technology.
    Active External - external scanning banner grabbing ping nmap netcat
    Passive Internal - native tools ip address arp cache netstat
    Active Internal - internal scanning network ports 
    
  ~Recon Steps
    Network Footprinting - Collect info relating to target: network, systems, organization
    Network Scanning - Port scanning, Network scanning, vulnerability scanning
    Network Enumeration - Network resources, users, routing tables, auditing service settings, names snmp and dns details.
    Vulnerability Assessment - Injection, broken authentication, sensitive data exposure, security misconfiguration. software with known vulnerability.
    
  ~Passive Recon Activities
    IP Addresses and Sub-domains
    Identifying External/3rd Party sites
    Identifying People
    Identifying Technologies
    Identifying Content of Interest
    Identifying Vulnerabilities
    
  ~DNS Lookups
    DNS Lookups:
    arin.net
    whois.domaintools.com
    viewdns.info
    dnsdumpster.com
    centralops.net
    
  ~IP addresses and sub domains
    URL scans
      sitereport.netcraft.com
      web-check.xyz
      web-check.as93.net
      urlscan.io
      
  ~IP Geolocation lookup
    maxmind.com
    iplocation.io
    iplocation.net
    infosniper.net
    
  ~Identify External 3rd Part sites
    Parent/Subordinate organizations
    Clients/Customers
    Service organizations
    Partners

  ~Identify People
    Target website
    Crawler tools like Maltego or Creepy
    Search engines
    Social Media
    Job Portals
    Tracking active emails
    Family Tree

  ~Identify Technologies
    File extensions
    Server responses
    Job listing
    Website content
    Google Hacking
    Shodan.io
    MAC OUI Lookup

  ~Content of Interest
    /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow or SAM database
    Configuration files
    Log files
    Backup files
    Test pages
    Client-side code

  ~Identify Vulnerabilities
    Known Technologies
    Error messages responses
    Identify running services
    Identify running OS
    Monitor running Applications

  ~Dig vs Whois
    Whois - queries DNS registrar over TCP port 43
      Information about the owner who registered the domain
    Dig - queries DNS server over UDP port 53
      Name to IP records

  ~P0f
    Examine packets sent to/from target
    Can guess Operating Systems and version
    Can guess client/server application and version

  ~Social Tactics
    Social Engineering (Hack a person)
    Technical based (Email/SMS/Bluetooth)
    Other Types (Dumpster Diving/Shoulder Surf)

  ~Scanning Strategy
    Remote to Local - red team network probe
    Local to Remote - off site equipment
    Local to Local - local sec manager
    Remote to Remote - remote site validating remote site

  ~Scanning Approach
    Aim
      Wide range target scan
      Target specific scan
    Method
      Single source scan
      1-to-1 or 1-to-many
    Distributed scan
      many-to-one or many-to-many

  ~Ping a range (Ping Sweep) (foot stomp)
    for i in {1..254}; do (ping -c 1 172.16.82.$i | grep "bytes from" &)

  ~NMAP Defaults
    Default Scan:
      User: TCP Full Connect Scan (-sT)
      Root: TCP SYN Scan (-sS)
    Default Ports scanned: 1000 most commonly used TCP or UDP ports

  ~NMAP port states
    open
    closed
    filtered - no reply, firewall filtered out
    unfiltered - accesible but unable to determine state
    open|filtered - unable to determine open or filtered
    closed|filtered - IP idle scan only, closed or filtered

  ~NMAP scan types (options)
    Broadcast Ping/Ping sweep (-sP, -PE)
    SYN scan (-sS)
    Full connect scan (-sT)
    Null scan (-sN)
    FIN scan (-sF)
    XMAS tree scan (-sX)
    UDP scan (-sU)
    Idle scan (-sI)
    Decoy scan (-D)
    ACK/Window scan (-sA)
    RPC scan (-sR)
    FTP scan (-b)
    OS fingerprinting scan (-O)
    Version scan (-sV)
    Discovery probes
    ICMP ping (-PE)
    No Ping (-Pn)
 
  ~NMAP Timeout
    -T0 - Paranoid - 300 Sec
    -T1 - Sneaky - 15 Sec
    -T2 - Polite - 1 Sec
    -T3 - Normal - 1 Sec
    -T4 - Aggresive - 500 ms (use this)
    -T5 - Insane - 250 ms

  ~NMAP Delay
    --scan-delay <time> - Minimum delay between probes
    --max-scan-delay <time> - Max delay between probes

  ~NMAP Rate Limit
    --min-rate <number> - Minimum packets per second
    --max-rate <number> - Max packets per second

  ~Traceroute Firewalking
    Set TTL value to right before the firewall
    See if traffic can pass before going through the firewall

  ~Netcat scanning
    -z : Port scanning mode i.e. zero I/O mode
    -v : Be verbose [use twice -vv to be more verbose]
    -n : do not resolve ip addresses
    -w1 : Set time out value to 1
    -u : To switch to UDP
