  ~Recon Stages
    Passive External - OSINT, DNS, Google searches, people technology.
    Active External - external scanning banner grabbing ping nmap netcat
    Passive Internal - native tools ip address arp cache netstat
    Active Internal - internal scanning network ports 
    
  ~Recon Steps
    Network Footprinting - Collect info relating to target: network, systems, organization
    Network Scanning - Port scanning, Network scanning, vulnerability scanning
    Network Enumeration - Network resources, users, routing tables, auditing service settings, names snmp and dns details.
    Vulnerability Assessment - Injection, broken authentication, sensitive data exposure, security misconfiguration. software with known vulnerability.

  ~Identify Vulnerabilities
    Known Technologies
    Error messages responses
    Identify running services
    Identify running OS
    Monitor running Applications

  ~Dig vs Whois
    Whois - queries DNS registrar over TCP port 43
      Information about the owner who registered the domain
    Dig - queries DNS server over UDP port 53
