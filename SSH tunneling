  ~Overview of tunneling
    Traffic Tunneling
      Mainly used for the IPv4 to IPv6 migration
    Tunneling Malware and Attacks
      Bypass IPv4-based security measures

  ~IPv6 over IPv4
    RFC 3056
    Permits IPv6 to be encapsulated in order to move through a IPv4 network
    Done by the Dual Stack Router
    Payload is not generally encrypted
    IPSEC commonly used to secure the payloads

  ~Dual Stack
    Configures an IPv4 and IPv6 address on all devices
    Resource intensive
    Allows for IPv4 and IPv6 routing because it has the addresses already set
    Can use both but not interchangeably

  ~6 IN 4
    Tunnel IPv6 traffic in an IPv4 Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnel
    Simple and deterministic
    Must be configured manually
    Commonly used for connecting IPv6 islands over an IPv4 network.
    Uses IP protocol 41

  ~6 TO 4
    Allows for IPv6 packets to be sent over an IPv4 network
    Enables automatic tunneling of IPv6 packets over an IPv4 network.
    Uses 6to4 gateways that encapsulate IPv6 packets within IPv4 packets.
    Allows communication between IPv6 networks across IPv4 infrastructure.
    Uses IP protocol 41

  ~4 TO 6
    Reverse of 6 to 4
    Uses next header 4

  ~Teredo Tunneling
    RFC 4380
    Allows IPv4 clients to access IPv6 clients
    Encapsulates IPv6 packets within UDP
    Commonly used for devices behind NAT
    Uses the 2001:0000::/32 prefix

  ~ISATAP
    Allows IPv6 hosts to communicate over an IPv4 network within a site (local network)
    Can be used over the internet for specific site-to-site communications.
    Generates a Link-Local address using its IPv4 address
    192.168.199.99 → FE80::0000:5EFE:c0a8:c763

  ~Covert Channels
    Using common and legitimate protocols to transfer data in illegitimate ways.
    Unauthorized/hidden communication between entities.
    Utilizes computer system resources, mechanisms, or protocols.
    Transmits information contrary to design intent.
    Bypasses security, violates policies, leaks sensitive data.
  ~Types
    Storage
    Payload
    Header
    IP Header (TOS, IP ID, Flags + Fragmentation, and Options)
    TCP Header (Reserved, URG Pointer, and Options)
  ~Timing
    Modifying transmission of legitimate traffic
    Delaying packets between nodes
    Watch TTL changes
    Watch for variances between transmissions
  ~Common Protocols
    ICMP
    DNS
    HTTP
  ~Detect Covert channels
    Host Analysis
      Requires knowledge of each applications expected behavior.
    Network Analysis
      A good understanding of your network and the common network protocols being used is the key
      Baselining of what is normal to detect what is abnormal
  ~Detect covert channel with ICMP
    ICMP works with one request and one reply answer
      Type 8 code 0 request
      Type 0 code 0 answer
    Check for:
      Payload imbalance
      Request/responce imbalance
      Large payloads in response
  ~ICMP covert channel tools

    Loki
    007shell
    ICMP Backdoor
    B0CK

  ~Detecting Covert Channels with DNS
    DNS is a request/response protocol
    1 request typically gets 1 response
    Payloads generally do no exceed 512 bytes
    Check for:
      Request/response imbalances
      Unusual payloads
      Burstiness or continuous use
  ~DNS covert channel tools
    OzymanDNS
    NSTX
    dns2tcp
    iodine
    heyoka
    dnscat2
  ~Detecting Covert Channels with HTTP
    Request/Response protocol to pull web content
    GET request may include .png, .exe, .(anything) files
    Can vary in sizes of payloads
    Typically "bursty" but not steady
  ~HTTP Covert channel tools
    tunnelshell tools
    HTTPTunnel
    SirTunnel
    go HTTP tunnel

  ~Steganography
    Hiding messages inside legitimate information objects
      Methods:
        Injection
        Substitution
        Propagation
  ~Injection
    Done by inserting message into the unused (whitespace) of the file, usually in a graphic
    Second most common method
    Adds size to the file
    Hard to detect unless you have original file
    tools:
      StegHide

  ~Substitution
    Done by inserting message into the insignificant portion of the file
    Most common method used
    Elements within a digital medium are replaced with hidden information
    Example
      Change color pallate (+1/-1)

  ~Propagation
    enerates a new file entirely
    Needs special software to manipulate file
    tools:
      StegSecret
      HyDEn
      Spammimic

  ~Secure Shell (SSH)
    Various Implementations (v1 and v2)
    Provides authentication, encryption, and integrity.
    Allows remote terminal sessions
    Can enable X11 Forwarding
    Used for tunneling and port forwarding
    Proxy connections

  ~Architecture
    Client vs Server vs Session
      Keys:
      User Key - Asymmetric public key used to identify the user to the server
      Host Key - Asymmetric public key used to identify the server to the user
      Session Key - Symmetric key created by the client and server to protect the session’s communication.

  ~Config Files
    Client Configuration File (/etc/ssh/ssh_config)
    Server Configuration File (/etc/ssh/sshd_config)
    Known Hosts File (~/.ssh/known_hosts)

  ~SSH Port Fowarding
    Creates channels using SSH-CONN protocol
    Allows for tunneling of other services through SSH
    Provides insecure services encryption

  ~SSH options
    -L - Creates a port on the client mapped to a ip:port via the server (open port on local box)
    -D - Creates a port on the client and sets up a SOCKS4 proxy tunnel where the target ip:port is specified dynamically
    -R - Creates the port on the server mapped to a ip:port via the client (open port on remote box)
    -NT - Do not execute a remote command and disable pseudo-tty (will hang window)
