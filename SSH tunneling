  ~Overview of tunneling
    Traffic Tunneling
      Mainly used for the IPv4 to IPv6 migration
    Tunneling Malware and Attacks
      Bypass IPv4-based security measures

  ~IPv6 over IPv4
    RFC 3056
    Permits IPv6 to be encapsulated in order to move through a IPv4 network
    Done by the Dual Stack Router
    Payload is not generally encrypted
    IPSEC commonly used to secure the payloads

  ~Dual Stack
    Configures an IPv4 and IPv6 address on all devices
    Resource intensive
    Allows for IPv4 and IPv6 routing because it has the addresses already set
    Can use both but not interchangeably

  ~6 IN 4
    Tunnel IPv6 traffic in an IPv4 Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnel
    Simple and deterministic
    Must be configured manually
    Commonly used for connecting IPv6 islands over an IPv4 network.
    Uses IP protocol 41

  ~6 TO 4
    Allows for IPv6 packets to be sent over an IPv4 network
    Enables automatic tunneling of IPv6 packets over an IPv4 network.
    Uses 6to4 gateways that encapsulate IPv6 packets within IPv4 packets.
    Allows communication between IPv6 networks across IPv4 infrastructure.
    Uses IP protocol 41

  ~4 TO 6
    Reverse of 6 to 4
    Uses next header 4

  ~Teredo Tunneling
    RFC 4380
    Allows IPv4 clients to access IPv6 clients
    Encapsulates IPv6 packets within UDP
    Commonly used for devices behind NAT
    Uses the 2001:0000::/32 prefix

  ~ISATAP
    Allows IPv6 hosts to communicate over an IPv4 network within a site (local network)
    Can be used over the internet for specific site-to-site communications.
    Generates a Link-Local address using its IPv4 address
    192.168.199.99 â†’ FE80::0000:5EFE:c0a8:c763

  ~Covert Channels
    Using common and legitimate protocols to transfer data in illegitimate ways.
    Unauthorized/hidden communication between entities.
    Utilizes computer system resources, mechanisms, or protocols.
    Transmits information contrary to design intent.
    Bypasses security, violates policies, leaks sensitive data.
